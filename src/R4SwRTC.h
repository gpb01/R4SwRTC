/*
   R4swRTC: a library to implement a software RTC on Arduino UNO R4 where the
   native RTC is overly inaccurate.
   The library will always be less accurate than a real RTC like the DS3231
   (because of the lack of quartz even on the main clock), but it can still
   be calibrated to have an error of about Â± 1 second over 24 hours.
   (In my UNO R4 WiFi, I had to use a value of 100.076 Hz for the timer, to
   get that precision)

   The original code of how to use a timer is taken from the following article
   https://www.pschatzmann.ch/home/2023/07/01/under-the-hood-arduino-uno-r4-timers/
   written by Phil Schatzmann.
